# Write a program that prompts the user to enter a line of sentences. 
# You can assume that each sentence in the line will terminate either with a full stop ("."), an exclamation mark ("!") or a question mark ("?"),  followed by a single space. 
# The program must convert the first letter of each sentence to uppercase (including the first sentence of the line).
